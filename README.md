# Python-Tello-Control
Controlling the Tello drone with Python

Based on the works from (https://bitbucket.org/PingguSoft/pytello)

## Requirements
For running the drone with video stream [MPlayer](http://www.mplayerhq.hu/design7/news.html) is needed.

## Running the program

```
python runWithVideostream.py
```

Starts the programm and directly outputs video stream to MPlayer.
You can then simply control the drone and view the video file.
